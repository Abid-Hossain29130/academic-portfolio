# Research Masterclass Project: Quantum Computing & Security

**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Karim Mohammed Rezaul
**Institution:** CARSIT, BCET, UK

## Project Overview

As part of a competitive research masterclass, I was tasked with developing a research proposal on the intersection of quantum computing and information security. This project involved a comprehensive literature review of seven peer-reviewed papers, the formulation of a unique research question, and the creation of a formal presentation.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Independently navigate and synthesize academic literature.
- Communicate complex technical concepts clearly.
- Adhere to professional standards of academic referencing and presentation.
